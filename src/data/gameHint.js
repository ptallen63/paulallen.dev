Hey!
Hello There!
The one looking at my code...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are obviously digging through my code for some reason.
I don't mind at all. Have a look a round.

But, I wonder if I might interest you in a friendly game of skill.

If you belive yourself worthy then open the "window" of your mind and "choose a pill".

If you like my work, then feel free to reach out at https://paulallen.dev/contact

Cheers,

Paul
