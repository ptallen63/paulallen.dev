                My path has been a bit different than most. I grew up in
                Alabama where I went to school for finance and banking. My
                    first career was at
              {' '}
              <a href="http://www.regions.com">Regions Bank </a>
                in Birmingham, AL. I soon worked my way up to the management
                team of a branch with a large deposit base. I was all of 23
                years old managing a staff where the youngest member was 49. I
                spent a great deal of time working on processes to increase
                customer service ratings and developing spreadsheet models to
                increase efficiencies and branch sales.

                While on vacation in Egypt, I was recruited to move overseas
                and do consulting work in the Middle East. Primarily working
                in Egypt, I engaged with small companies who wanted to expand
                their operations into western markets. Around this time the

                Just before leaving for Egypt, I met the woman who is now my

                I landed a job with a small university doing admissions and
                recruiting for adult evening programs. I discovered that I
                enjoyed working in this field and that I was a natural at

                population.
