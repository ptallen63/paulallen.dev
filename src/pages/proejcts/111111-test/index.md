## Description

The Grade Calculate mobile app gives you the power of GradeCalculate.com on your mobile device. This was my first step into mobile development, and it has been a very successful experience. A new version of the mobile app is currently in development to bring the same look and feel of GradeCalculate 3.0 to the mobile App. This app was built with the Ionic framework which utilizes Angular 1.x. The next version will use React Native.
