## Description

Neville JS is a simple node CLI that cleans a list of emails from a CSV file. It checks to make sure there are not any blanks in the email field, no duplicates, and no emails that are in invalid formats. This is a program I open-sourced to do simple cleaning of email lists that were given to me in my job. These lists would often have several errors that added time to getting my tasks done. I am in the process of developing a web client version to make it more accessible for all users.
