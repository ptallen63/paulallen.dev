## Description

Wardrobe Library was a classroom library software that was built for my wifeâ€™s elementary classroom. It integrated with a scanner and kids were able to check out books, search the inventory, and see what books were at their reading levels. The teacher was able to get an overview of his or her inventory and see if students were reading at, above, or below their reading levels. The stack for this software was Angular 1.x for the frontend with a REST API built in PHP using the Laravel framework for the backend and MySql as the database solution.
