## Description

This webapp  shows a grade table  given a number of questions on a quiz, test, or exam. It was built in response to my wife losing her paper EZ-grader and neeing a quick solution. What started out as a simple fix for my wife has blossomed into an app that is used monthly by 30,000 people around the world.  The stack is ReactJS  for the frontend and a NodeJS backend running the ExpressJS framework.
