## Description

Paultallen.com is my personal website and access point for the Internet. I could have done something simple like a wordpress site, but I wanted to showcase my abilities as well as experiment with new technologies that I want to learn. The main stack for this site is React JS served off of a Node JS  backend running the ExpressJS framework. It is constantly evolving and changing as I change.
