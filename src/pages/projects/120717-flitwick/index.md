## Description

Flitwick is a simple CLI that I am working on to solve the problem that I seemingly get every day. The use case is I have one list of emails in a `.csv` file and I want to know if those emails exists on another list in a `.csv` file. Flitwick takes the two lists, compares them, and spits out the rest in `output.csv` file. I am currently working on getting the match list to match up the properties from the match-to list.  I also hoping to create a spertale library to use in other projects.
