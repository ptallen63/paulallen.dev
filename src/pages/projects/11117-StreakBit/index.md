## Description

StreakBit was a proof of concept habit tracking webapp. It allowed users to set daily habits, then mark when they completed them. As the user built up streaks, they were awarded more and more points. The tag line was ‘turn streaks into habits’. This project was built in 2015 when Angular 1.x was at the height of its dominance. The stack for this app was Angular 1.x on the frontend with PHP as the backend running the CodeIgniter framework and MySql as the database solution.
