## Description

Each fall for the past 4 years I have taught a section of University 101 at the University of South Carolina. I wanted to give my students an easy place to find information about our class. I created a site from which all information was disseminated. This site was one of my first full Javascript stack projects. The frontend is Angular 1.x running on a NodeJS backend using ExpressJS with MongoDB as the database solution.'
