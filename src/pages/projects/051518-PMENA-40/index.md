## Description

In November of 2018 PME-NA has its 40th annual conference. The needs for this site were informational with an emphasis on registration. The design needed to be responsive as well as required implementation across the entire stack. This site has a ReactJS front end coupled with the GatsbyJS static site generator. Other than using the Semantic UI library all code is custom and built from the ground up for the client.
